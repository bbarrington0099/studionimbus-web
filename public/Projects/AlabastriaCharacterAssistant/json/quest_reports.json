Tharos fought alone with only his faith in Tempus and his determination to protect the innocent. His armor was torn, his face scarred, but his resolve was unbroken. The victory speech he gave while standing over the wyvern's corpse became the guild's founding oath. The village he saved, Millhaven, later became one of the guild's strongest supporters and a major recruitment center. This solo victory also established Tharos's core philosophy: that those putting their lives on the line should determine their own methods, as long as the innocent are protected. When founding the guild, he welcomed hunters of all stripes - soldiers and sellswords, druids and rangers, rogues and mages - many bringing methods he might never use himself, including poison, forbidden magics, and merciless execution. He saw the necessity in diverse approaches to monster hunting.",
