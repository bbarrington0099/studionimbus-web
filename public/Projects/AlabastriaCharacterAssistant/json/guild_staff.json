Her hands are calloused from both brewing and healing, and her ever-present smile carries both mischief and kindness.",
        "personality": "Lively, compassionate, and endlessly curious about others. Kinris does everything with flair, often too much, but her energy is infectious.

        "background": "Born to a wandering caravan, Kinris found her place among The Huntbound Order as much for her wit and brewing as for her healing touch. She became the guild’s unofficial heart: tending wounds, pouring drinks, and listening to the burdens of hunters who return from bloody work. Though she avoids killing, her strategic mind aids guild hunts with clever plans and mentalist insight. To many members, Kinris is both a sister and a counselor — the keeper of secrets, scars, and spirits (both strong drink and soulful guidance)."

He aids hunters not by blade but by insight, scribing records of their deeds and providing arcane knowledge crucial for their survival, recently publishing a collection of his findings through research and experience in his 'Monster Slayers Guide'.

Though not cruel, he has little patience for wealth or refinement, believing only experience in the wild proves worth.

He takes pride in teaching others the craft of smithing, seeing the forge as both a crucible and a bond between warriors.",
        "faith": "He holds no faith in gods, but honors the strength of the wilds, storms, and mountains as forces that shape all beings.",
        "background": "Exiled from his clan for reasons he rarely speaks of, Varon carved out a life as an outlander, living by strength, grit, and knowledge of the land. His exile turned to belonging when he joined the Huntbound Order, where his tracking skill, endurance, and raw might found new purpose. Yet his truest gift lies in the forge: Varon serves as the guild’s blacksmith and smithing trainer, shaping weapons and armor that carry Huntbound hunters into battle. The clang of his hammer is as constant as the roar of beasts on the hunt, and his forge is open to any guildmate seeking to learn. Though quiet and guarded, he is a steadfast companion on the hunt and a shield for those he calls kin."

Her fur is dark and unkempt, often streaked with soot and grease from her tinkering. She wears studded leather armor hidden beneath a patched and scorched apron, with belts full of tools and trinkets jangling at her sides. Her quick hands and restless stance give the impression of someone always ready to steal, fix, or break something.",
        "personality": "Defiant, hot-tempered, and fiercely loyal to those she calls friends. Risha thrives on proving others wrong and takes insults personally, often lashing out in bursts of temper. She has little patience for plans or authority, preferring to improvise and follow her instincts. Despite her criminal past, she values bonds of loyalty above all else and will fight tooth and claw for those she owes her trust.",

        "background": "Once a criminal and fence in the underworld, Risha made her name by stealing, tinkering, and reselling goods with clever improvements. Her reckless streak nearly ended at the gallows until the guildmaster himself spared her life after she stole and modified his greataxe, impressing him enough to grant her a place in the guild. Now serving as the guild’s artificer and black-market contact, she repays her old debt through loyalty and craft, while never quite losing the chaotic spark that first carried her into trouble."

He wears plain but well-kept shirt with a brown leather vest, and keeps a wooden practice sword at his side wherever he goes.",
        "personality": "Quiet but determined, Lemun carries himself with a sense of responsibility rare for his age. The loss of his family has made him mature quickly, but underneath his stoic front lies the heart of a child who still longs for safety and belonging. He has developed a strong sense of justice and fairness, sometimes stubbornly so, and looks up to the guild members as both mentors and surrogate family.",
        "faith": "Having studied in the guild’s temple and learned from many members’ different devotions, Lemun chose to follow Kelemvor, Lord of the Dead and Justice. He prays to him not only for the safe passage of souls, but for the strength to ensure justice for the living and the fallen. His faith is quiet but resolute, rooted in the belief that death should be honored and justice always served.",
        "background": "Lemun was only eight years old when his village was attacked and burned by a horde of goblins, leaving his parents dead. Hiding alone among the ruins for days, he was eventually found by a Huntbound Order guild party sent to investigate. They rescued him, and while accompanying them he learned much about goblins and their ways. Taken back to the guild hall, he was given the rank of Copper with the understanding that he would serve, train, and grow within the guild until he could properly take up the adventuring mantle. Now, at 11 years old, Lemun works as the guild’s butler — tending to the hall, helping with chores, and assisting the members as needed. Though still young, he has already shown a fierce devotion to justice and carries within him the promise of a protector destined to rise."

His tusks are slightly worn, and one bears a small chip from a long-forgotten scuffle. His skin is a muted green-gray, marked with faint scars, and his black hair is kept shaved close to the scalp for practicality. His deep-set eyes gleam with shrewd intelligence. He typically wears a heavy apron, with knives and spice pouches hanging from his belt like weapons of his trade.",
        "personality": "Gruff but generous, Bolagor has a practical nature shaped by years of hard work. He is stubborn when it comes to coin and haggles relentlessly, yet he does so for the good of the guild rather than selfish gain.

The workshop where he apprenticed remains sacred to him, a place he believes forged his identity. Never content to settle, he sought greater purpose beyond simple trade, eventually finding a place within the Huntbound Order. There, he became the guild’s cook and negotiator, ensuring not only that the members are well-fed but also that their supplies and expenses are managed with keen efficiency. Though gruff with his coin, he is ultimately generous, viewing his skills as gifts meant to benefit the world. He is known among the guild as a man who can turn the humblest of rations into feasts and the harshest of merchants into allies."

However, the constant web of lies and danger grew wearisome, and Jade sought a new path. Leaving espionage behind, she joined the Huntbound Order, turning her skills toward adventuring and monster hunting. It was during this period that Jade formed a pact with an Archfey patron, honing her powers as a warlock. Age and experience, however, eventually led Jade to retire from field work. With retirement came the dissolution of her fey contract, the bond fading as she stepped away from the life of quests and combat. Now, Jade serves the Huntbound Order as its quest receptionist and records keeper, managing missions, tracking reports, and ensuring the guild’s operations run with precision. Though no longer wielding eldritch power, Jade’s sharp mind, calm demeanor, and gift for subtle persuasion make her just as valuable as ever."

She was raised for a time by a band of druids until a fateful encounter with a wild beast forced her into a cavern where she discovered an ancient standing stone marked with draconic runes. Touching it bound draconic power to her forever, awakening her bond with a drake. For years she survived in the forests alone, guided by both Fey whispers and her newfound draconic strength, until she finally gathered the courage to journey into cities. There she lived as a ranger, selling her skills and slowly making her way across the land. Eventually, Fiona joined the Huntbound Order, where her knowledge of beasts and survival proved invaluable on countless quests. During her time adventuring, she fell in love with the guild's groundskeeper Ilikan, and after marrying and giving birth to their son, she chose to retire from the dangerous life of quests. For the past nine years, Fiona has served as the Huntbound Order’s official Beast Master, tending to the guild’s mounts, companions, and familiars. With her drake at her side and a heart still tied to both the Feywild and her draconic blessing, she is a constant presence of care, guidance, and wonder within the guild."

His hair is thick and dark, often tied back, and his beasthide features give his skin a rugged, weathered look reminiscent of stone. His eyes carry a gentle steadiness, betraying his giant upbringing through their calm depth. He dresses in simple, durable work clothes, often marked by earth, grass, or dust from tending to the guild grounds.

He often repeats the saying, 'Every avalanche begins as a single pebble,' a reflection of his giant-raised philosophy that great change comes from humble beginnings.

        "background": "Raised in Bulsania by a clan of giants, Ilikan grew up immersed in their traditions of strength, patience, and respect for the natural world. Though smaller than his adoptive family, he carried their teachings with him, shaping his steady worldview. In his early twenties, he wandered far from home, eventually arriving in Skratonia almost by accident. There he crossed paths with Tharos, the Guild Master of the Huntbound Order, who took a keen interest in this unusual shifter with a giant’s upbringing. At the time, the guild was expanding and in need of a new hall, and Tharos offered Ilikan the position of groundskeeper. Ilikan accepted, and over the years became a cornerstone of the guild’s daily life. Alongside tending to the land, halls, and gardens, Ilikan earned renown within the guild as a skilled mender — sewing garments, repairing armor, and fixing tools with the same care he applies to nurturing the grounds. During his service, he met and married Fiona Mirage, the guild’s Beast Master, and together they now raise their son within the safety of the guild hall. Though no longer an adventurer, Ilikan’s quiet strength, resourceful hands, and devotion to both craft and family make him indispensable to the Huntbound Order."
